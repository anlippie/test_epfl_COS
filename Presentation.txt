Hi everybody! 
Here is Andrea Lippiello, an electronic engineer working
at CERN for the upgrade of the safety systems in the LHC
accelerator. 
In my current job I am not using neither data
analytics nor coding. Anyway, in my previous experience as 
testing and characterization engineer at STMicroelectronics, 
I was the person in charge of analyzing the electrical data 
gained from the qualification test of an advanced electrical 
non-volatile memory technology under development. In this
context I've widely used many Python packages like pandas,
openpyxl etc. (mainly libraries to work with excel files and
and data arrays).
