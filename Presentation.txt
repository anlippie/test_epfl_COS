Hi everybody! 
Here is Andrea Lippiello, an electronic engineer working
at CERN for the upgrade of the safety systems in the LHC
accelerator. 
In my current job I am not using neither data
analytics nor coding. Anyway, in my previous experience as 
testing and characterization engineer at STMicroelectronics, 
I was the person in charge of analyzing the electrical data 
gained from the qualification test of an advanced electrical 
non-volatile memory technology under development. In this
context I've widely used many Python packages like pandas,
openpyxl etc. (mainly libraries to work with excel files and
and data arrays).


I have decided to enroll in this COS course as from
the next August I will start a new position in Italy, in the 
national central Bank, as ICT officer. I will work daily with 
data and AI, which I have studied from the theoretical point of 
view but I've never applied on the field. My expectation is
to get more practical with these concepts, getting more
prepared in view of my new work experience.
